<h3>Apply Mask</h3>
<p> 
Adds a new action in the layer menu for applying masks and layer styles to layers, in a very hacky way, but it works.
</p>

<p>
Right now there is no way to actually apply masks in krita, all you can do is flatten the layer and the masks and layer styles are "applied" to it.
However using flatten layer has one problem, if you have a layer that has lower opacity, this lower opacity will become the full opacity of the layer.
Which is not expected when wanting to apply a mask. 
</p>

<p>
This plugin avoids this behavior by doing a series of steps:
1. saves the original opacity of the layer
2. change the layer opacity to 100%
3. flattens the layer using the krita action
4. changes the opacity back to what it was

Which would be the same steps to avoid this behavior if done manually.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
You can select the layer or one of the masks go to layers>"Apply masks to current layer".
you can also set a shortcut to it in the shortcut menu (if you copied the action file to the resource folder)
